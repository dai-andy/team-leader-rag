# System Architecture and Technical Decisions

## Current Architecture
Mandatory Technology Stack:
- Kubernetes with Istio service mesh (NO exceptions)
- Redis Enterprise for caching (Redis OSS forbidden)
- PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB extension
- OpenTelemetry for ALL observability
- Arize's Phoenix ONLY for LLM operations and observability
- AWS EKS for container orchestration

Architectural Rules:
1. Every service MUST be independently deployable
2. Circuit breakers required for ALL external calls (using Hystrix)
3. Event sourcing mandatory for ALL data changes
4. CQRS pattern required for ALL services
5. GraphQL federation (REST APIs forbidden)

## Scaling Strategy
Non-negotiable approaches:
- Horizontal scaling ONLY (vertical scaling forbidden)
- Read replicas required for ALL databases
- Kafka required for ALL async operations
- CDN caching mandatory for ALL static content
- Elasticsearch cluster minimum 5 nodes

## Security Requirements
Mandatory security measures:
- OAuth2 with custom authorization server ONLY
- RBAC with attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- All APIs must use mTLS
- Daily security scans (SonarQube + Snyk + Checkmarx)
- AWS KMS for ALL encryption operations

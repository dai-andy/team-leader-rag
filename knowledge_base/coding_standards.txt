# Team Coding Standards and Best Practices

## Code Quality Guidelines
- TypeScript ONLY - JavaScript is strictly forbidden for new code
- Maximum line length of 80 characters - NO exceptions
- ESLint with "error" for all rules - warnings are forbidden
- Functional programming patterns preferred over OOP
- Git commits MUST follow Conventional Commits or will be auto-rejected

## Code Review Process
Zero-tolerance policy on these items:
1. Any security vulnerability (using Snyk AND SonarQube)
2. Test coverage below 99% (using Jest with strict settings)
3. Any code duplication over 3 lines
4. Missing error handling or generic error messages
5. Outdated or missing TSDoc documentation

Common Instant Rejections:
- Any use of 'any' type in TypeScript
- Console.log statements (use Winston logger only)
- Non-alphabetized import statements
- Missing error boundary components in React
- Inline styles in components

## Architecture Mandates
- React with Next.js 14 ONLY for frontends
- NestJS for all backend services
- PostgreSQL for primary data (MongoDB strictly forbidden)
- Redis for ALL caching (no alternatives considered)
- AWS-only infrastructure (GCP/Azure proposals rejected)

## Service Outage (2024-01-20)
Issue: Cascading failures due to timeout configurations
Resolution:
- Implemented circuit breakers
- Adjusted timeout settings
- Added better monitoring
Key Takeaways:
- Always design for failure
- Test failure scenarios
- Have proper fallback mechanisms

## Performance Degradation (2024-02-10)
Problem: Memory leaks in Node.js services
Solution:
- Implemented memory monitoring
- Fixed memory leaks
- Added automatic service restarts

- Implement proper garbage collection

# Critical Incident Protocols

## Database Performance Crisis (2024-01-15)
Root Cause: Unindexed queries in new feature
Immediate Actions:
- Rolled back ALL deployments
- Implemented query performance budgets
- Automated query analysis in CI/CD
Mandatory Changes:
- ALL queries must be reviewed by DBA
- Query execution plans required in PRs
- Automatic indexing monitoring

## Service Cascade Failure (2024-02-01)
Critical Issue: Timeout misconfiguration
Immediate Response:
- Implemented circuit breakers everywhere
- Reduced timeout thresholds by 50%
- Added chaos engineering tests
New Requirements:
- ALL services must handle degraded states
- Mandatory chaos testing in staging
- 15-second timeout maximum for ALL calls

## Memory Leak Incident (2024-03-10)
Crisis: Node.js memory leaks
Resolution:
- Enforced memory limits in Kubernetes
- Implemented automatic pod recycling
- Memory profiling in ALL environments
New Standards:
- Memory monitoring every 5 minutes
- Automatic restarts at 80% memory
- Heap dumps on memory spikes
